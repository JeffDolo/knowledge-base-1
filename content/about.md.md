Hello!  I’m Jeff Dolo.  
I’m currently exploring how version control tools like Git and GitHub can be used to manage content and build websites.  
Outside of my coursework, I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my writing, and finding better ways to share knowledge with others.  

This project is just the start of my journey into creating structured, useful content for learning and collaboration.
